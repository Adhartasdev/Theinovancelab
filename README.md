# The Inovance Lab


The Inovance Lab is an e-commerce store derived from a French Laboratory Ysonut.fr that produces nutraceutical and dietary products. With a strong focus on office health it attempts to start a new office norm through proper support of the Circadian Rythm. In addition to basic products it has started to sell a Phyto brand which is 100% plant based. 

The current deployment has been made for functionality purposes, the store will in the future comprise 100 of products making its functionalities such as price order, categories and searching relevant. In the long term, the idea is to provide office nutritional products enabling health and boosting the productivity of employees through subsidised micro-nutrition by the employer.

# UX

## Project Goals

The project goal has been to develop a first version e-commerce site to sell Phyto and Inovance Brand products under the name of "The Inovance Lab". This being said, Inovance is the name of the Micro-nutrition products of Ysonut.fr. The idea is to start selling in both the United States and Europe. As this is a pilot project we would like to carry out in Miami, we have denominated the pricing in USD. The interesting, part of the website is the user profile, as later it would be the source of intelligent profiling for suggestion making based on past purchases and logical in-take plans when it comes to nutraceuticals.

## Design Choices

* The design of this e-commerce was made with the Guidance of Boutique Ado demonstration of the Code Institute. I took the design over with slight alterations, as it fits the ambitions of my company to have a simple, straightforward and non-complex exposition of the products and brand. As a laboratory, the domination of the white color on the site is important for its users to perceive it as clinical. 

#### Fonts

* For the fonts, I used Lato obtained through google fonts for its cleanliness, which relates to the previous Design choice justification. 

#### Icons

* Icons were imported from Font Awesome and relate to ecommerce logic or health. (Credited at the end)

#### Colours 

* The colours used are focused on white, black green and a bit of yellow for notifications.

#### Background, Images & Audio

* All images used throughout the site are either property of Ysonut SL, or have been obtained through unsplash. There are no dense pictures or background images in the site, neither should there be. 
* Background used are white of nature.
* Product images originate from the product database of Inovance and should all be with white background colours. 
* Home page might change in the future, as it is complex to find the perfect background picture for an pharma/clinical site that matches perfectly with the theme at hand.
